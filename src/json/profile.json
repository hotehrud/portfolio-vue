I’m satisfied with my life. l love it.<br/><br/>I would really love to share the information to someone who is interested in IT.<br/>So as a first step for it, I decided to start on my blog.<br/>I’d really happy if somebody get some information through the blog.<br/>So I’m posting some data steadily on it for sharing.<br/><br/>I’ve been focusing too much on programming, so sometimes I spend a lot of time for it.<br/>Technically, For some people, it seems like wasteful.<br/>Even if it is slow and unnecessary practically, I’m just thinking that I’m doing right.<br/>By doing this, I’m improving steadily my tech.<br/><br/>Now, I’m developing more toward a front-end, because I have a tendency for planning and design.<br/>As a front-end, I use vanilla-javascript for a project and I have decided to use vue.js as framework.<br/><br/>In addition to it, I would really love to talk to foreigners so I have been studying English for 30 minutes a day.",
